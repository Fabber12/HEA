Sim (T=3300K) stopped at 105700 steps (~1ns). Therefore no "liq_or_sol.data" file from lammps (there is actually a .data file due to the fact that I exported timestep 1000000 from OVITO, generating the .data file).
I run this sim with "iso" barostat. Then I tried with "aniso" ones for other temperatures.
